# Applications of natural language processing

## Language modelling
### Activities
* Predict the next character, word, or sentence

### Applications
* Predict next letter, word, or sentence that the user will type (e.g. in google search or in an email)
* Can be useful offline -- e.g. in MS Word on airplane, or on a the keyboard of a phone with poor internet

### Demos
* TODO
